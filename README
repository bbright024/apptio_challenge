DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION 
#######################

        My plan: install an HTTP server on the main app host machine, listening on
a port that is inaccessible from outside the firewall.  Pretty simple,
just add a rule in iptables/ACL preventing WAN access on that port, and test it
later from the outside with noisy nmap scans.  Thus the app would only respond
to GET requests originating from inside the organization, and could reply with
JSON, plain text, or HTML.

   However, that HTTP design completely depends on the devs accessing the
server from a private IP address.  If the main app were in a container out in
the cloud, this would be a little trickier.  Port forwarding/NAT could be done
for requests coming from a specific range of IP addresses, but an attacker can
easily spoof his/her IP.  Another option would be to write a client side proxy log
server that uses an SSH tunnel to connect with the log server on the main
machine.  A client side proxy would solve many other issues as well, by sort of
trunking requests from devs so that the main machine log server would only need
to track one TCP connection.

  From what I've seen, kubectl has the same issue - insider access for devs,
but none for the clientele.  Thus, if the main app in the problem is
cloud-based, I'd have to either
  a) install keys for each dev
  or
  b) write a client-side proxy server that operates in the organization's
     internal network, and install a key for that server in the worker nodes
     for the main app.
  or
  c) have some kind of ticket authentication/authorization service like kerberos
     configured for the log server.

    Writing a client-side proxy is definitely a goal of mine, if I get that
far. Log entries will never be changed - so if the client requests a search of
entries in a range that the proxy has cached, there's no need to ask the main
app server for a log update.  In the client-side program, caching would reduce
network load.  In the server side program, caching would reduce system calls &
disk I/O requests, leaving more resources available for the main app.

Further ideas/issues:
     - have the server take a conf file so the admin doesn't need a long string of flags
        for each startup of the program
	   *** did this, but see the configuration section for more details.  it's
	       crazy how dependent the app is on deployment - basically, need to come up with
	       deployment before you start coding configurations.
	       
     - big read requests of the log file could slow down the main app
         Possible solutions:
           - add a limit to how much a user can access at one time
	   - only run the search when the CPU isn't under heavy load
	   - before any requests, cache as much of the log file into memory as possible
	   - cache results (both client side and server side)
	   - depending on the OS, change the 'nice' level of the log server process
         	   *** turns out all this cgroup stuff can easily be implemented by Dockerfile
	
     - the server side app will need read access on the log file and any
        archived log files.
     - network traffic of sending log search results could impact performance for main app
     - upgrades to the server side program API shouldn't break clients that assume
         an older API
     - if using a proxy, could batch requests & send as one to the log server
     - filtering the log file kinda reminds me of MapReduce; curious if there's anything I can
        do with that. 
     - instead of passing a conf file location to main in argv[], could write a few CLI prompts
       that, when the server is first executed, ask the user for either a config file location
       AND/OR values to use instead.
     - add a way to restart the logserver if it gets a sigsegfault or sigkill or any other
       signal that terminates the process.  Back in C you could use setjmp and sigsetjmp
       to save the process's environment early on in main, and jump back to that spot with
       a sig handler function that called siglongjmp.  I'm curious if there's a way to do
       that in Go, or if such a solution is even allowed in a container.  Definitely a
       question I'll be bringing up during my on-site interview. 
       

BIG ISSUE:
      As of 4/13/2018, every request to the logserver reads the entire log
   file in from disk (or the kernel's file cache buffer if it hasn't been
   evicted - no control over that though).  This will not scale if the log file
   to read gets to be terrabytes in size.  There's a few solutions that differ
   depending on if the file is small enough to fit in memory or not.
      - if the log file can comfortably fit in memory, then we should load & parse
        the entire file at runtime & save it as a global array of log entries.
	We could also save the byte offset where we last encountered an EOF when
	parsing the log file (or the size of the file itself).  Then whenever a request
	comes in to read the log file, we'd only need to check if the log file
	is bigger now than it was during the last parse, and if it was, lock the
	global array and update all the globals.
	With this approach, a search by date of log entries wouldn't need to check
	for updates if the range of dates being searched is contained within the
	array of logentries.  However, if searching for a word in a log message, 
	the log file would still need to be checked for updates.
	 - This introduces a few more problems, however.
	   1. If an attacker can't change the values in the log file itself,
              he/she could change the values in the global array of log entries
	      in the logserver to cover his/her tracks.
	   2. a lock on the global array of logentries creates a new host of
	      issues.  If there are a ton of updates since the last read to
	      parse and the CPU resources given to the logserver cgroup is low,
	      devs accessing the logserver could spend a while waiting for a
	      response.  
      - If the log file CANNOT fit in memory, every client request would have to
        read in chunks at a time of the log file, parse it, send it, and repeat.
	This would eliminate the possibility of concurrent requests, since a single
	client would be using all the memory available to the cgroup.  In this situation,
	having a client-side proxy server would be almost mandatory. The proxy would
	have more RAM and CPU power available, giving it a better caching power and thus
	a better ability to serve concurrent requests.  

BIG ISSUE:
       I don't know how the <datetime logtime> is formatted.  Go provides a
   time.Parse function that turns strings into Time values, but it needs either
   an example string or one of the constants in the time library.  I thought
   about having a control flow switch if no example string is provided, meaning
   it would keep the datetime entry as a string, but since the other case would
   return a value of Time, I'd have to have two different structs for log
   entries.  Go doesn't have unions/one-of types, so I could do something clever
   with interfaces here to have the code work in both cases.
       My current solution splits the log entries up by "," and assumes that the
   first comma is the first byte after the datetime string.  If the datetime format
   used in the main app log file has commas in it, this will break the output
   format and any searchability.
       In the real world, this problem wouldn't be an issue because the format
   would be known ahead of runtime, and the logserver could refuse to run without
   a proper datetime format specified for parsing the log file.  I can't allow a
   default example string format, because it's an assumption that could cause a lot
   problems if it were accidentally used. 



############
ALTERNATIVES
############

 - log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", http.FileServer(http.Dir("/usr/share/doc"))))
     If the log file were used in that http.Dir call, the logserver program would be
     ~10 lines of code.
        -problems:
           pretty brittle.  If the log file gets large or archived, updates to 
           the logserver would be needed to accomodate changes. However, it's the
           simplest & quickest solution to the problem we're trying to solve.
               
- Give every dev root access to the main app host machine
    - Not an option - too many security issues, and could lead to devs installing
      unneeded tools/programs on the machine.

- Modify the kernel by writing a new syscall that takes an inode and tells the kernel
    to never evict that inode's disk blocks from the kernel's internal page cache.
    However, it's doubtful that the log file would ever be evicted anyway, since the
    main app will never close the file descriptor pointing to that inode.
      - problems:
         - Downtime; such a patch would likely require a restart 
         - If the kernel is open-source, non-proprietary, we'd have to fork from
           the mainline and have continuous maintenance on our new kernel, like
           how Google maintains Android.  However, we could try to merge our code
           into the mainline if there
         - It's possible this is already an option, so we'd need to do some research
           to make sure we aren't reinventing the wheel
         - Complexity, time, resources required, and adding kernel code can introduce
           a great many bugs. 

- Write a caching client proxy server that forwards dev requests.  If all devs go through
   the proxy, there will be a large reduction in CPU, RAM, disk I/O, and network resources
   used by the log server on the main app host machine. 
   - problem:
        It's a little beyond the scope of the problem we're trying to solve, and introduces
        a security vulnerability. Without more information, it's impossible to know if caching
        log files external to the server is allowed. Also, a malicious actor could cover his/her
        tracks by changing values saved in the cache.
      
- Add rsyslog to the main app host machine & copy the log files to an external database
     -problem: 
        Not enough information is known about the situation.  Rsyslog is more resource
        intensive than my small log server implementation - maybe smaller is better. 

- Add Kerberos to the network & check tickets whenever log files are requested.
   Adding authentication/authorization to the log server would allow for a much
   more dynamic API.  Server admin specific commands could be added, e.g. change configs
   without having to restart the server.
      -problems:
        - increases complexity of the system as a whole
        - Even though main app customers wouldn't need to go through kerb, they might still
          see slowdowns.  For instance, a dev might write a script that grabs log files every 10 seconds,
          and overhead of decrypting/encrypting those messages by the server app on the host machine
          could bog down the system.
        - This is beyond the scope of the main problem - getting the devs access to the log files.
    
- Chmod the log files to a group on the host OS, give that group read privileges,
   give devs an account on the server they can SSH into, and add that account to the group. a cron job
   could be added to the host to add log archive files to that group with read privileges.
     -problems:
         - assumes the security policy is ok with devs having ssh access to the machine.
         - would be hard to track which dev is using the account and at what time

- Add in a sandbox program to let devs pass in their own functions to filter the log
     -problem:
        complexity.  Something like this would take a long time to build, test, and deploy.
        

###############
DEPLOYMENT PLAN
###############

The deployment plan of the logserver is highly dependent upon the extra
software installed on main app host machine.  For instance, a deployment plan
relying on Docker images would not work if Docker wasn't already installed on
the main app machine, since installing docker while the main app is deployed
could introduce new bugs, security vulnerabilities, and resource utilization
that wasn't planned for.  Thus, any deployment plan should not rely on having
to install new packages.

The deployment also depends upon the infrastructure of the system.  For
example, if the system is fault-tolerant with more than one machine running
the main app, deployment needs to be run on each machine.  Thus, any scripts used
should not assume any specific machine will be the target.

WITHOUT DOCKER:
A deployment plan would need to take these steps:

0. Run unit tests to make sure everything still works
1. Compile a logserver binary that is arch/OS compatible with the main app host machine
   - save a hash value of the binary so we can periodically check the binary in deployment
      to see if it's been modified
2. scp the binary & other relevant files into the same namespace as the log files
3. use ssh [command] to run a script on the main host machine completing these steps:
  a) chmod/chown the binary
    - make sure the server binary isn't root
    - create a group that only the binary & the log files are part of
    - give the group read only privileges to the log files
  b) write either a cron job or a systemd service that adds any new or archived
     log files to the group
  c) have cron or systemd start/restart the server when needed
  d) create a chroot environment for the logserver binary inside the main app log
     directory
  e) add the logserver to a cgroup & limit it's CPU/RAM resource availability
  f) On the gateway machine/router connected to the WAN, modify NAT/port
      forwarding to prevent external logserver access, and/or add a rule to the
      ACL/iptables preventing access from WAN IP's to the port used by the server.
        - note: this would assume devs access the logserver from internal IPs, or
          there is a VPN tunnel setup inside the organization to grant devs internal
          IP addresses
  i) Make sure current user doesn't have root privileges, and execute the server binary
     with "chroot . /logserver"

To run these steps as a bash script, a few details must be known about the target:
  1) IP address
  2) CPU architecture
  3) Kernel version

If there are multiple host machine targets, we could create a JSON file
containing an array of machine data.  The deployment script would parse the
JSON file and run the deployment for each machine.

WITH DOCKER:
1. Create a Dockerfile that
   a) downloads a Go-alpine image
   b) limits resources of the image
   c) links the logfile in as a volume for the logserver
2. Run a script that will scp the Dockerfile
   to the host machine and run it


###########################
MONITORING/REPORTING/ALERTS
###########################

Things to log:
  a) the config file used at runtime
       - the entire file itself, or just a few parameters if too long
  b) request IP origins for each interaction, possibly what they request as well
  c) any errors, of course
  d) could log user agents of the connecting devices, to focus future development
     on a specific hardware/software.  Random, but got the idea from a CMU lecture.
     
Alerts:
  - Send an alert if one IP address is making a ton of requests -
     having the main app be DDOSed by a log server wouldn't be fun to explain to
     clients of the main app.

Monitoring:
  - use heartbeats from an external source to make sure the server is still running.
      In cloud architectures, I think that's what "circuit-breakers" are for, but
      as of 4/12/18 I still don't have a full view. 
      In an old-school deployment, I could set up a cron job that uses netcat or
      some other net suite program to send a HEAD request to the log server.
      If the server didn't respond for a few requests, sound the alarms!  Could
      send a text to a sysadmin.

    Go's logging design makes it easy to have a program's log file be located
on a seperate machine.  Output can be written to a socket, since log.SetOutput
takes an io.Writer interface as the parameter.  To ensure fault tolerance, we
could do a dup system call on the logging file descriptor, causing writes to
occur to both a local file and to the socket file.


#############
CONFIGURATION
#############

One area of parameters to set are cgroup settings:
     maximum memory
allowed, max cpu resources, stuff like that, which would be set in the
Dockerfile.

    There's also monitoring alert settings - where to send alerts, where and how often
to send out heartbeat messages, and trigger levels for auto banning an IP to prevent
DOS attacks.

More program-specific configurations:
 a) port to bind on
 b) if caching is enabled, maximum cache size to be used
 c) location of the main app log file in file system for the log server
 d) location of the logserver config file 
 e) which RPC methods to enable/disable
 f) Datetime format in the main app log: <datetime logtime> - dd/mm/yy, mm/dd/yy, etc.
    - the time pkg in Go has a time.Parse() that needs either the
      RFC number specifying string format, or an example string format.
      Either of these could be specified in configuration.

    Since there's no authentication/authorization of the incoming requests, every
configuration value must be set on execution.  If anyone could change log
server settings via RPC without a/a, the settings would be impossible to keep stable.

#######
TESTING
#######

SMALL TESTS:
    For unit testing the Go code, I followed testing conventions reccomended by
"The Go P.L.".  Table-driven testing makes it easy to check corner cases and
prevents the need to duplicate assertion logic [pg 306].  Running Go unit tests
is also very easy - the "go test" command is much simpler than maintaining a
Makefile for testing C code, and whenever "go test" has a failed test, the
nonzero exit code will halt any bash script.  Code coverage and benchmark
testing are also simple to do with Go tools.

MEDIUM TESTS:
I wrote a bash script that checks the behavior of the logserver during runtime.
The script: 
  1. compiles and runs the logserver
  2. uses curl to make a call to /read on the logserver
  3. displays the log file the server was supposed to read,
      and the results of the call to read.
      
Because my logserver parses the log file, I couldn't use the diff tool to
compare the webpage and the 


To make sure the API worked properly, I ran the logserver on localhost
and in a local Docker container, and used a web browser to access the proper
address:port/uri.  

LARGE TESTS:
Prior to deployment, we need to run the logserver alongside the main app.
We must:
   1)  Confirm that the two apps do not conflict and the logserver has proper
       access to the main app log files
   2)  Ensure the logserver does not slow down the main app when under heavy
       load, and tweak the cgroup settings as needed
   3)  Quantify the logserver's impact on network throughput
         - I've been reading that limiting network bandwidth of a
           cgroup/container is a tricky issue that hasn't yet been solved.
           We should still test the impact to get an idea of what might happen
           if we deployed the logserver.
           

FURTHER TESTS:
 -  When deployed, use noisy nmap scans from outside the organization to make
      sure the log server port is inaccessible from the WAN.
 -  If the logserver takes queries, could use a fuzzer to try and find query
      strings that cause the program to crash
